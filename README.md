### Hours

Way too many to count, spent a lot of time wrestling with Autolayout this weekend.

### Completion

Not 100% complete. Near the end, I started getting 400s from the Yelp API and I could not figure out why.

* What's missing:
  * Had issues with parsing categories out.
  * Did not get to category filtering.
  * Radius search not implemented correctly.
  * Only back button, no Search / Cancel on filter view.
  * Polish
  * Gif
  * Not able to completely verify filters due to 400 api return.
